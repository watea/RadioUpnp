<p>ðŸ”Š <b>Foreground Playback Notice</b><br>
Playback is always started manually by the user via a Play button.<br>
To ensure continuous playback even when the app is in the background or the screen is locked, a <b>foreground service</b> is used with a visible and controllable notification (play/pause, next/previous).<br>
This complies with Google's policy for <code>FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK</code>.</p>

<p>ðŸ“¡ <b>UPnP Streaming Notice</b><br>
When streaming to a UPnP/DLNA speaker, RadioUpnp uses a foreground service with a clear playback notification and device control.<br>
This complies with Google's policy for <code>FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE</code>.</p>

<p>ðŸ“Œ <b>Troubleshooting Tips</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some phone brands (e.g. Samsung, OnePlus) may apply battery optimization that disrupts streaming. Disable optimization in battery settings for RadioUpnp.</li>
  <li>Streaming quality and compatibility depend on your UPnP/DLNA device (supported CODECs, etc.).</li>
  <li>If you use ad blockers or firewall apps, UPnP streaming may be blocked.</li>
  <li>Need help? Use the in-app Report function to contact the developer.</li>
